        <div class="about-me"><p>
            A little about me, I am 26  years old and currently attending the Java development bootcamp at Tech Elevator in Cleveland, Oh.
            My past experience includes 7+ years of management experience in both customer service and operational capacities. In this
            experience I have learned how to excel in a team enviornment and make sure everyone on the team is building off of each other.
            I strive to learn as many new things as I possibly can to equip myself to be a great addition to a development team. <br/>

                    <p>
                        This is a program I wrote for a Home Run pool I take part in with a few of my former co-workers. Prior
                        to this program I kept an excel spreadsheet with each players home run totals by visiting a different website
                        for each player. I used webscraping through Jsoup to write a Java program that does all of the research for me,
                        as well as totalling up the team totals with up-to-the-minute stats.

                            Web application using Spring MVC, PostgreSQL, JDBC/DAOs, Java/JSTL/JSPs for HTML and CSS. Set up a web page using 
                            database info relating to National Parks and their details. The page tracks user preferences by manipulating session 
                            data. Users can take the daily survey and view the favorite parks based on the database stored surveys.

                    <p>
                        This was a mini-capstone project for Tech Elevator where my partner and I put together a Java Command Line program
                        that allows a user to view campground/reservation information as well as make reservations. We focused on the use of JDBC
                        and PostgreSQL for all information usage pertaining to the National Parks Campground database we were using.

                        Another mini-capstone at Tech Elevator. In this pair-project my partner and I applied our knowledge of
                        File Input/Output to read a .csv file to populate an inventory for a virtual vending machine. This command line
                        interface program allowed users to view and purchase items out of the vending machine while keeping track of user balance,
                        item inventory, transactions, and reporting sales.
